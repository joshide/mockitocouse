//Stubbing
Stubs are the sample implementations of the class and can be used in unit testing.
Stubs suffer from two problems. 1: Dynamic Condition , 2: Tightly coupled to Service they stub
Dynamic condition : if we want our method of stub to return different values, we need to put if-else condition. This can go out of hand
very soon and not an optimal solution.
Whenever Service is modified(Adding a new interface, removing existing interface), stubs will break as they implement these services.

//Mocking
Mocks are much more dynamic than stubs.
Mockito return nice mocks (default values) when the methods are not stubbed.
Using Mockito, we can return multiple values of the stubbed methods.
Mockito provides support for argument matching.
Mockito provide support for exception throwing.
